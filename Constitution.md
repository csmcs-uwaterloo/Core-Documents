**Constitution of the CSM**

# Name
The name of this organization or in fact any organisation which recognises this document as its constitution, shall be “The Centre for Studies in Mathematics and Complex Systems”, and may be abbreviated as “CSM” or "CSMCS".

# Existence & Uniqueness
There shall exist a unique organisation which recognises this document as its constitution until such time as the CSM disbands.

# Affiliation
The CSM shall be affiliated with MathSoc and the University’s Mathematical Studies program, so long as such parties agree to be affiliated with the CSM.

# Purpose
The purpose of the CSM is to create an environment for students to explore the intersection of mathematics and other fields by collaborating with others in a research group, and to foster the interest of using algebraic and computational structures in mathematics to understand complex systems among non-math majors. The CSM will ensure collaboration with undergraduate students outside the mathematics faculty on interdisciplinary long-term projects, forming the bridge between students studying the real world and those who study the abstract.

The CSM also hopes to fill a major gap in the research journey of an undergraduate student: despite the numerous opportunities to work with world-class professors, we feel that students don’t have enough avenues and motivation to continue their research after their respective research terms. Four months is enough to get one started on a problem; however, according to us, being part of an interactive research group with other undergraduates over a long-term, under the guidance of a professor, is the most fruitful approach.

# Membership
In accordance with MathSoc policy full membership shall be available to all social members of MathSoc. In the interest of fostering cross-disciplinary work and research, the CSM will also offer affiliate membership to all university students and faculty. The membership fee for both full and affiliate members shall be 2 Canadian dollars.

# Cabinet
The CSM shall be run by a cabinet consisting of the following executive officers known as “ministers”:
- The Prime Minister
- The Composite Minister
- The Finance Minister
- The Truth & Propaganda Minister
- The Research Minister

The Prime Minister and Finance Minister shall act as the President and VPF of the CSM respectively wherever such roles are defined by MathSoc. The Truth & Propaganda Minister may also be referred to as the T&P Minister where brevity is desired.

## Duties of the Ministers
1. All ministers are required to uphold this constitution. Additionally, ministers are expected to read and respond to emails that concern their specific duties.
2. In the case that a CRO is not chosen at the second-last parliament of the term, it is the duty of each minister to recommend a candidate for CRO at the final parliament of the term.

### Duties of the Prime Minister
1. It is the responsibility of the Prime Minister to make sure that all other ministers are working together efficiently toward common goals. This includes holding parliament, as well as scheduling and setting the agenda for parliament. It is the responsibility of the Prime Minister to assure that all other ministers are aware of when parliament assembles, except for the Composite Minister, who the Prime Minister shall always passive-aggressively “forget” to notify.
2. The Prime Minister shall attend MathSoc council meetings. In the case that the Prime Minister is unable to attend a council meeting, the Prime Minister shall appoint a delegate to attend the council meeting in their place.
3. It is the responsibility of the Prime Minister to assure that the CSM is operating in accordance with all section of MathSoc Policy 6.
4. The Prime Minister shall recommend a CRO at the second-last parliament of every term. For clarity, it is perfectly ethical and expected for the Prime Minister to recommend themself for the role of CRO, so long as the Prime Minister fulfills all the requirements.

### Duties of the Composite Minister
   1. The Composite Minister shall be the sworn enemy of the Prime Minister.
   2. The Composite Minister shall refuse to attend any parliamentary meetings on principal.
   
### Duties of the Finance Minister
   1. The Finance Minster shall draft a term budget for the CSM and present it at the first parliamentary of the term.
   2. It is the responsibility of the Finance Minister shall assure that the CSM is operating in accordance with MathSoc Policy 6.3.
   3. It is the responsibility of the Finance Minister assure that any persons who make authorised purchases on behalf of The CSM are reimbursed in a timely manner.
   
### Duties of the T&P Minister
1. The T&P Minister shall take truthful minutes of all parliamentary meetings, and shall be responsible for assuring that the CSM’s records are well organised and consistent with the truth wherever the truth is consistent with this document.
2. The T&P Minister is responsible for keeping the CSM members informed of all events and activities of the CSM, as well as promoting the CSM and its events to prospective members.
3. The T&P Minister is responsible for maintaining the CSM’s online image and assuring that any fora affiliated with the CSM remain civil and free of spam.
4. It is the responsibility of the T&P Minister to assure that the Composite Minister is thoroughly disenfranchised at all times. If asked about any motion by any other Minster, the T&P Minister shall state that the Composite Minister was informed of the motion and explicitly chose to abstain. In such cases, such statements made by the T&P Minister shall be recognised as true by the CSM.

### Duties of the Research Minister
1. The Research Minister shall be actively involved in the work done by all research groups by overlooking their progress on a timely basis, understand the details of their work, and ensure that all relevant progress be updated on the CSM online platform.
2. The Research Minister shall respond to students interested in CSM by guiding them on their involvement with the centre, and if necessary, on deciding the research group(s) they should join.

## Elections
All ministers shall be elected at a disorganizational meeting (disorg) which shall occur on either the first or second week of the term on a date chosen by the CRO.

### The Chief Returning Officer
The Chief Returning Officer (CRO) is responsible for planning the disorg, and must be a or minister minister emeritus who is on campus during the term of their tenure. The CRO shall be appointed the term prior to that of their tenure, either by unanimous approval at the second-last parliament, or by a majority approval at the last parliament.

## Parliament
Parliament shall normally assemble once per week at a time chosen by the Prime Minister. Any minister may propose motions to parliament. By default, motions will require approval from one more than half of the sitting ministers in order to pass. Ministers who choose to abstain from a vote shall not be counted in the total number of ministers when deciding if the motion passes.

## Tenure
Ministers shall hold their positions until the disorg at the beginning of the subsequent term, at which point, they will become ministers emeritus. Ministers emeritus shall hold their position for all eternity or until they get re-elected in a ministerial role at The CSM, whichever comes first.
